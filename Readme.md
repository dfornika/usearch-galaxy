# Galaxy Tools for usearch v10+

A 32-bit version of `usearch` is available to download here: 

https://www.drive5.com/usearch/

The usearch license does not allow re-distribution of the `usearch` binary. These tools assume that a Galaxy Administrator
has manually installed `usearch` somewhere that is accessible on the galaxy system `PATH` and the binary is named `usearch`.
